Mobility is a bus booking system to help Ashesi Staff conveniently book and pay for their rides digitally eliminating the manual method of tally assignment and queueing for bus onboarding. This system  allows the logistics department and drivers effortlessly manage faculty accounts, allowing them to add, modify, or deactivate accounts easily.
